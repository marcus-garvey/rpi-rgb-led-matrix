Controlling RGB LED display with Raspberry Pi GPIO
==================================================

This is a merge of the RPi Led RGB Matrix sources 
https://github.com/Boomerific/rpi-rgb-led-matrix

and the Adafruit GFX Library
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library

Both librarys working together. You can use the GFX library to draw on the RGB display.
I added a double buffer, which reduce the flickering of the display.
